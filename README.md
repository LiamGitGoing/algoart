# Generative Art

This is a generative art piece that changes depending how many flights are near you, and specifically how distant they are. 

## Installation

There is no installation required. You can simply clone or download the project and open the index.html file in your browser.
Usage

When you run the application, you will see a map with a "Look up" button. Clicking the "Look up" button will retrieve flight data from the OpenSky API for the current location of your device. The application will then generate a moving art-piece, where the number and size of the individual art elements is determined by the received flight data.
